The UI and UX of an app play such an important role in its success. These factors are key to delivering a program or service that is useful and engaging. A good UI/UX design can draw new users to <!--more-->your app and it is also what keeps them coming back.

As important as UI/UX design is, a [mobile app design agency](https://www.bluelabellabs.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} and individual app developers also need to recognize the fact that the trends are always changing. What may have looked good a few years ago might look dated by today’s standards. New technologies may also affect the trends of smartphone app design.

With a new year just getting underway, here are the UI/UX trends that will have the biggest impact in 2020.

#### Storytelling
The technical side of UI/UX design will always be important, but it is hard to beat a good story. You will find a lot of apps that perform well from a technical standpoint, but they don’t have a story to connect with the user. While storytelling has been a part of UX design for some time, it is only going to increase in importance in the coming years.

When designing an app, you need to think about the purpose of the app and what you hope to offer users. If you can integrate this with a story that works with the purpose of the app, you will be able to deliver an experience that is more engaging. 

#### Augmented Reality 
The use of [Augmented Reality](https://www.livescience.com/34843-augmented-reality.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} in smartphone apps is not new, but it is going to become an integral part of an increasing number of apps. Whereas early AR features were more of a gimmick, newer AR experiences are going to be core to the service that is being offered. Users will be able to get information overlaid on real-world environments on the screen of their smartphone and they will be able to use apps that interact with items in the real world to expand upon the experience and make the service more convenient.

#### Asymmetrical Layouts
The standard grid design is simple and functional, so it isn’t going anywhere. That said, there will be an increase in apps that use asymmetry and broken patterns. When it is done right, it can offer a good way to capture the user’s attention and guide them to the features you want them to pay attention to. 

#### Device Synchronization 
Multi-platform is the way of the modern internet. Consumers no longer access online services through just a PC or smartphone; you now have your laptop, your phone, a smartwatch and digital voice assistants. Today’s consumer expects to be able to access and use services from all of these platforms. For app designers, that means you are going to have to develop an experience that is seamless across multiple devices.

#### Voice Controls
Tapping and touching are still important parts of the user interface, but more apps are starting to integrate voice controls. The hands-free operation makes the apps more convenient and it also allows the user to interact with the app in a way that is more natural.

#### Artificial Intelligence 
Artificial Intelligence in smartphone apps has come a long way in the last few years. Much of this is due to advances in [machine learning](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/machine-learning.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}, which has made it possible to develop apps that are much smarter than those of the past.

One example is how apps can now collect and analyze data. Developers can now create apps that use vast amounts of information to customize the experience for the user. Today’s smartphone user is starting to expect services that know and anticipate their needs and wants, and AI is the key to offering this type of experience.

Staying up to date on the current UI/UX trends will help you to develop the best app possible. However, it isn’t just about following the trends that are hot when you develop the app – what is hot today might be stale tomorrow. Stay aware of how trends change and update your app to meet the demands of users as the market evolves.
