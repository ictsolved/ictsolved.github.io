AsteroidOS, an open-source operating system for WearOS initiated four years ago by a computer science student has received it's first stable version 1.0 release. It was going through Alpha testing during December 2016 and is currently on the playground as an alternative to Google's WearOS <!--more--> . It can be considered as a Linux distribution for smartwatches in a sense that it is built upon Linux technologies like Wayland (a display server protocol), systemd (system and service manager), Qt5 (software that enables to develop GUI applications) etc.

This release of AsteroidOS works on smartwatches like LG G Watch, LG G Watch Urbane, LG G Watch R, Asus Zenwatch 1, Asus Zenwatch 2, Asus Zenwatch 3, and Sony Smartwatch 3. In few weeks it will probably be ported to more smartwatches unofficially as the Software Development Kits (SDK) is also released for the developers with series of example and tutorials. One can start porting by following their wiki [here <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://asteroidos.org/wiki/porting-guide/){:target="_blank"}. With that said, the further official releases for more smartwatches is down the road.

### What features are currently available?
It includes various nifty features such as accessing phone notifications, setting alarms, using as a remote control for music application, customizing settings, viewing weather forecast, etc. All these features can be synchronized on the go with its companion app AsteroidOSSync using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

### What's interesting for developers?
As mentioned earlier, SDK, libraries, documentation, examples, and tutorials are already available to the developers. They can help to contribute to the project by porting the OS to supported devices or developing new connectivity features well as synchronization applications for new platforms such as iOS because only Android is supported at the moment.

### What to expect next?
Looking at the post from the developer, the possibility for new features seems limitless. However, we can at least expect to get features like always-on display, grouped notifications, calendar synchronization and synchronization application for other platforms too which means support for iOS. 

Although Google is in the lead, AsteroidOS has initiated its journey too. We are looking forward to hearing lots of exciting features and improvements in the upcoming updates.
