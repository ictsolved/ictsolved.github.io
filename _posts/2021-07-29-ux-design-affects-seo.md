Most site administrators and digital marketers understand the importance of SEO, but they don’t always know about the impact their UX can have on their search rankings. In fact<!--more-->, Google and other search engines consider various aspects of the user experience when ranking websites on the search engine results page.

In this article, we’ll explain how the user experience is intertwined with SEO performance and outline what search engines are looking for in an ideal site. While keywords, backlink profiles, and other basic elements are crucial to SEO rankings, your site won’t be able to achieve its full potential without a strong user interface and user experience. If you’re still stuck for guidance on UX matters, think about working with a [digital product studio](https://bighuman.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} for a professional’s opinion and advice.

### How Google Ranks Sites
Google’s search algorithms are [notoriously complicated](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"}, but they generally focus on one thing: showing you the best sites that are most relevant to your search query. Furthermore, Google is constantly adjusting its algorithm to continue providing the right results for every search.

RankBrain is a little-known aspect of the search calculation that can have a dramatic effect on your site’s position on the search engine results page. Understanding how RankBrain works will help you make the right adjustments to make your site more visible on Google and other popular search engines.


### Google RankBrain
RankBrain is the [third most important](https://searchengineland.com/faq-all-about-the-new-google-rankbrain-algorithm-234440){:target="_blank"}{:rel="nofollow"} element when it comes to Google search results, but only a small percentage of site owners and digital marketers understand how it works. Rather than looking at your text, RankBrain focuses on things like your bounce rate, click-through rate, and average number of visited pages per session.

These metrics are intended to show Google how well the average visit goes on your site. Websites that push visitors away after a few seconds will typically rank below sites that keep them interested for a longer period of time. Of course, RankBrain is still just one of many factors used to calculate your search ranking.

### Contemporary SEO Priorities
If you’ve been marketing on Google for a long time, you probably remember the days when exact matches were the best way to get the top spot. Over time, Google’s algorithm has focused less on specific keywords and more on the user experience.

With that in mind, there are no longer any shortcuts when it comes to improving your ranking. Where you end up on the search page depends on your keywords, backlink profile, and user experience along with numerous other factors.

Ultimately, the simplest way to build a better site is to consider what your visitors are looking for. Developing to their needs will have a positive effect on their experience as well as your SEO ranking.
